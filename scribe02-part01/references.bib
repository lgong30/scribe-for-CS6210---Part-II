  abstract  = {Parallel architecture has become an important nay of providing high performance computation to users. For the last few years many high performance computers have been built The BBN Butterfly family of multiprocessor systems is one example of such systems. This family supports both shared memory and message-passing models of computation. This paper reviews two BBN Butterfly systems; the BPP and the GP1000. The review highlights the architecture, the operating system, and the programming environment supported by each machine. Some applications that has been conducted on these two machines are also mentioned.},
